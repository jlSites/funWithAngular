You'll build a basic app that\nhas many of the features you'd expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven app: acquiring and displaying\na list of heroes, editing a selected hero's detail, and navigating among different\nviews of heroic data.</p>\n<p>You'll use built-in directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.\nYou'll create components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.\nYou'll use one-way data binding for read-only data. You'll add editable fields to update a model\nwith two-way data binding. You'll bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.\nYou'll enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view. You'll\nformat data with pipes. You'll create a shared service to assemble the heroes.\nAnd you'll use routing to navigate among different views and their components.</p>\n<!-- CF: Should this be a bullet list? -->\n<p>You'll learn enough core Angular to get started and gain confidence that\nAngular can do whatever you need it to do.\nYou'll cover a lot of ground at an introductory level, and you'll find many links\nto pages with greater depth.</p>\n<p>When you're done with this tutorial, the app will look like this <live-example name=\"toh-pt6\"></live-example>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-youll-build\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"tutorial#what-youll-build\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>What you'll build</h2>\n<p>Here's a visual idea of where this tutorial leads, beginning with the \"Dashboard\"\nview and the most heroic heroes:</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/toh/heroes-dashboard-1.png\" alt=\"Output of heroes dashboard\" width=\"558\" height=\"232\">\n</figure>\n<p>You can click the two links above the dashboard (\"Dashboard\" and \"Heroes\")\nto navigate between this Dashboard view and a Heroes view.</p>\n<p>If you click the dashboard hero \"Magneta,\" the router opens a \"Hero Details\" view\nwhere you can change the hero's name.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/toh/hero-details-1.png\" alt=\"Details of hero in app\" width=\"277\" height=\"261\">\n</figure>\n<p>Clicking the \"Back\" button returns you to the Dashboard.\nLinks at the top take you to either of the main views.\nIf you click \"Heroes,\" the app displays the \"Heroes\" master list view.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/toh/heroes-list-2.png\" alt=\"Output of heroes list app\" width=\"208\" height=\"573\">\n</figure>\n<p>When you click a different hero name, the read-only mini detail beneath the list reflects the new choice.</p>\n<p>You can click the \"View Details\" button to drill into the\neditable details of the selected hero.</p>\n<p>The following diagram captures all of the navigation options.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/toh/nav-diagram.png\" alt=\"View navigations\" width=\"506\" height=\"433\">\n</figure>\n<p>Here's the app in action:</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/toh/toh-anim.gif\" alt=\"Tour of Heroes in Action\" width=\"563\" height=\"711\">\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"up-next\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"tutorial#up-next\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Up next</h2>\n<p>You'll build the Tour of Heroes app, step by step.\nEach step is motivated with a requirement that you've likely\nmet in many applications. Everything has a reason.</p>\n<p>Along the way, you'll become familiar with many of the core fundamentals of Angular.</p>\n<p>Start now by building a simple <a href=\"tutorial/toh-pt1\" title=\"The Hero Editor\">hero editor</a>.</p>\n\n</div>"
